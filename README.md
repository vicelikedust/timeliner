# Timeliner

Make a super simple, self-hosted timeline of your life by forking this repo and editing a config file.

Example: **https://vicelikedust.github.io/timeliner**

## Why

When everyone was reflecting on their past decade at the start of 2020, I made a timeline of my past 3 decades. It was heavily inspired by [Harper Reed's site](https://harperreed.com).

Timelines are a fun way to visualize someone's life and get to know them quickly. You can see their life's trajectory and important highlights. This is not meant to be a resume. Have fun with it - share quirky moments and fun anecdotes!

Or just use it as a changelog template for your software. What do I care?

## How

1. Fork this repo
2. Edit `_config.yml` to fill in your personal details and timeline events. Delete or update `CNAME`.
3. Go to your fork's settings tab, scroll down to the GitHub Pages section, select the `master` branch source and click Save.
4. Visit http://username.github.io/timeliner

This is a minimalist Jekyll template that spits out a single self-contained `index.html` file. To build the page yourself, run `jekyll build`
